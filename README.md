# bman-win

## Installation

Just change the `BMAN_DOWNLOAD` var to where you want it installed, then delete the original bman.cmd file

Make sure this script has permission to access that folder

Don't forget to add `[BMAN_DOWNLOAD]\bin` to `PATH`

## Use

See bman -h for command info

When a version is required the syntax is `bman [option] [major version] [minor version]`

Note, there is a space between the major and minor version rather than a dash or dot
